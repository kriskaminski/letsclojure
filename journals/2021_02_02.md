### Played with automating data sync to GCP bucket
### Afternoon and whole evening spent documenting different network setups as I need to submit 4 assignments by the end of week.
### Moreover it turned out that REPL in VS Code couldnt start
#### I think it tried to download something from Maven (npm for Java?) which is I guess caused by work VPN.
## DONE Read [[Chapter 3 Do Things: A Clojure Crash Course]]
